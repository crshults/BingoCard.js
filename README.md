# BingoCard.js

My first stab at a responsive bingo card widget. Eventually I'd like it to be 99% JavaScript so that you can just add <div class="BingoCardContainer" /> to your html along with maybe some additional classes to choose from a few different styles of cards.

Also will have an api for daubing and clearing.

Lots to do on this.
